## Introduction
Welcome to **Gemilingo** ‚Äì a powerful AI-driven language translation app designed to break language barriers. Whether you're a traveler, a student, or a business professional, Gemilingo helps you communicate effortlessly with real-time translation features.

## Background Story
The idea for **Gemilingo** was born when a first-time visitor came to church and could only speak French. It was quite difficult to communicate with him, and I could only rely on translation apps that were slow and lacked real-time interaction. This experience made me realize how challenging it can be to bridge language barriers in everyday situations.

Gemilingo was created to solve this problem‚Äîproviding real-time text and voice translation to enable seamless communication, whether in conversations, meetings, or social interactions.

This experience led to the development of Gemilingo‚Äîan app that not only translates text and speech but also allows **real-time spoken language translation**, converting speech into voice notes in the user's preferred language.

## Key Features
### 1. Text-to-Text Translation
