# Gemilingo User Documentation

## Introduction
Welcome to **Gemilingo** â€“ a powerful AI-driven language translation app designed to break language barriers. Whether you're a traveler, a student, or a business professional, Gemilingo helps you communicate effortlessly with real-time translation features.

## Background Story
The idea for **Gemilingo** was born when a first-time visitor came to church and could only speak French. It was quite difficult to communicate with him, and I could only rely on translation apps that were slow and lacked real-time interaction. This experience made me realize how challenging it can be to bridge language barriers in everyday situations.

Gemilingo was created to solve this problemâ€”providing real-time text and voice translation to enable seamless communication, whether in conversations, meetings, or social interactions.

This experience led to the development of Gemilingoâ€”an app that not only translates text and speech but also allows **real-time spoken language translation**, converting speech into voice notes in the user's preferred language.
